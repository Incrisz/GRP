To create a virtual environment and install packages within it, you can follow these steps:

Install the virtualenv package (if not already installed):

=> pip install virtualenv

Create a new virtual environment:

=> virtualenv myenv

This command creates a new directory named myenv, which will contain the isolated environment.

Activate the virtual environment:

On Linux/macOS:

=> source myenv/bin/activate

On Windows (Command Prompt):

=> myenv\Scripts\activate.bat

or (PowerShell):

=> myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Once activated, your command prompt or terminal should indicate that you are now using the virtual environment.

Install the packages within the virtual environment:

=> pip install -r cryptographic_requirements.txt

This command will install the packages listed in the cryptographic_requirements.txt file within the virtual environment.

By using a virtual environment, you can avoid potential conflicts and ensure that the project dependencies are isolated from the system-wide Python installation.
